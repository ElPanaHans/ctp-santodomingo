    "title": "About Our Pet",

    "p1": "In 2017, a staff member from Santo Domingo Technical Professional College (CTP) in Heredia was walking to work when he felt like someone was following him. He looked back nervously and saw a medium-sized, multicolored dog wagging its tail. Instead of chasing it away, the staff member decided to bring the dog to school, and Danger hasn't left his side since. The CTP director indicated that if the dog wanted to stay, it was welcome, as dogs often choose where they want to be.",
    "p2": "Thus began the story of this dog, whom the community named Danger. Danger has played a fundamental role in the educational center. In the mornings, Danger accompanies the cleaning staff in their duties. In the afternoons, he can be found at the school entrance with the security guard.",

    "p3": "In addition to his duties, Danger also acts as a public relations officer and participates in all CTP activities. He even has an Instagram account where he shows off his outfits, duties, and participations. At the CTP, Danger is very loved and cared for. He has a house, bed, food, vaccinations, and plenty of company.",
    "p4": "The security guards take care of Danger on his days off, and when he gets sick, a veterinarian attends to him. Danger has never left the school. The arrival of Danger has generated empathy, responsibility, and care within the educational community.",
    "p5": "Some believe that Danger was mistreated in the past. However, with all the love he receives from the students, teachers, and administrators, they hope he has been able to forget his suffering."
